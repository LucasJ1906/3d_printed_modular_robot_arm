#TODO:
-Share mechanical design with BOM and assembly and manufacturing instructions
-Share software architecture, with a tutorial for installation and usage


(I'm actually working on another project and don't have the time yet to share more details about the design. Please feel free to contact me directly if you are interested and want more details.)
